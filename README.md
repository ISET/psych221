# Image Systems Engineering (Psych 221)

This repository includes the homework scripts for Image Systems Engineering, Psych 221.

The scripts rely on the ISETCam simulation that we use in class.  That software can be downloaded from the Canvas web site, or from [ISETCam](github.com/ISET/ISETCam).

We find that for Mac and Windows [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/) is a good way to manage repositories.  It is possible this app has been [extended to Linux],(https://gist.github.com/berkorbay/6feda478a00b0432d13f1fc0a50467f1?permalink_comment_id=4809015) too. From the terminal, you can clone this way

    git clone https://github.com/iset/psych221.git
    git clone https://github.com/iset/isetcam.git

We may, from time to time, need to update these files during the class.  If you need to update your local copy, change into your local directory and type

    git pull

The repository is open, so we hope there are no authentication issues.

Onward,
Brian
