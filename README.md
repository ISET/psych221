# Image Systems Engineering (Psych 221)

This repository includes the homework scripts for our class.  They rely on the ISET simulation that we use in class.  That software can be downloaded from the Canvas web site.

Please clone this repository as

    git clone https://github.com/scienstanford/psych221.git

We may, from time to time, need to update these files during the class.  If you need to update your local copy, change into your local directory and type

    git pull

Thanks,
Brian, Trisha, and Joyce
