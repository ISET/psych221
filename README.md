# Image Systems Engineering (Psych 221)

This repository includes the homework scripts for our class.  They rely on the ISET simulation that we use in class.  That software can be downloaded from the Canvas web site.

We find that for Mac and Windows the best way to work with GitHub, now that they have tightened up on their security, is to use the [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/).  

We are less sure about Linux, where there is no widespread agreement on an app.  The main goal is pretty simple, though.  You must need to clone this repository, say using

    git clone https://github.com/isetcam/psych221.git

We may, from time to time, need to update these files during the class.  If you need to update your local copy, change into your local directory and type

    git pull

There repository is open, so we hope there are no authentication issues for you.

Thanks,
Brian
