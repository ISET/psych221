# Image Systems Engineering (Psych 221)

This repository includes the homework scripts for our class.  They rely on the ISET simulation that we use in class.  That software can be downloaded from the Canvas web site.

Please clone this repository as

    git clone https://git./scienstanford/psych221.

We may, from time to time, need to update these files during the class.  To update your local copy, change into your local repository and type from the command line:

    git pull
    
 
Thanks,
Brian, Trisha, and Joyce
