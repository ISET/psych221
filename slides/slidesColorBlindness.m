% We apply a linear transform to protan/deutan/tritan fundamentals. We can
% use a different linear transform for each of the deuteranopic CMFs and

%%  The intersection of planes

% Create a single matrix that has the two dimensions of one type of
% dichromatic in the first two columns and the two dimensions of a second
% type of dichromatic in the second two columns.

X = [deutan,tritan];  % L-cone
% X = [protan,tritan];  % M-cone
% X = [protan,deutan];  % S-cone

% We find the intersection of the two deuteranopic planes by solving this
% equation
%
%   0 = X*nullVec
%  
% The solution is the null vector of this matrix.  I could have done it
% another way, I suppose.  But this seems clear to me.  We find the solution
% to 0 = X'*X * nullVec from the svd.
%
[U,~,~] = svd(X'*X);

% Check that this a pretty good null vector
assert(max(abs(X*U(:,4))) < 1e-15)

% Now find the weighted some of the first two columns that is in the
% intersection. It will be the negative of the second two columns in the
% intersection.
nullVec = U(:,4);
est = X(:,[1,2])*nullVec(1:2);
